I confirm that I have completed LAB0 and understand the course policies.

Name: Phillip Muvadi
Course: EECE5554

Ubuntu:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) is installed and working on my laptop.

Git:
- Git is installed and working (e.g., `git --version` runs successfully).

ROS 2:
- ROS 2 Humble is installed and I can build and run ROS 2 packages using colcon.

Challenges during installation:
- Issue: Initial ROS 2 pubsub nodes showed "No executable found"; fixed by correcting setup.py entry_points and rebuilding with colcon.
- Issue: Git accidentally tracked colcon build/install/log artifacts; fixed by updating .gitignore and removing cached artifacts from the repo.
- Issue: Wi-Fi connectivity on Ubuntu was unstable (connection drops / adapter not recognized at times); workaround was using Ethernet/phone hotspot when needed while troubleshooting drivers/NetworkManager.
